    (^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$)

    ^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+
        >> starts with (1 or more letter, number, +, _, -, .) then
    @
        >> a single (@) sign then
    [a-zA-Z0-9-]+
        >> (1 or more letter, number, -) then
    \.
        >> a single (.)
    [a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$

  > regex syntax:
      NOTE = matches with quantifiers will try to also match other characters that are concatinated
             best practice is to have prefix and suffix of \s to prevent concatinated match

      (characters)
      \d    a digit 0-9
      \w    letter, digit, or underscore
      \s    whitespace character (also matches empty character)
      \D    not a digit
      \W    not a word character
      \S    not a whitespace character
      .     any character except line break

      (quantifiers, how much does the pattern need to happen)
      +       one or more
      {3}     exactly x times. {3} - 3 times
      {3,5}   three or five times
      {4,}    four or more times
      *       zero or more times
      ?       once or none (optional)
