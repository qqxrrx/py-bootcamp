__init__ = classes in python has this special method that is called upon object creation
self = refers to instance of current class, does not receive arguments


in python to instantiate a class (other language uses a "new" keyword but python does not):

  obj = Class()


Variable Naming Conventions:

  __(method)__ = dunder methods, special methods that already exists at Python that we override and change it's behavior

  _(variable) = treated as a private variable, can still be accessed publicly but by convention don't access it

  __(variable) = accessed as _(classname)__(variable), called "name mangling"
               = make this method/attribute particular to this class
               = mostly used for inheritance to avoid naming conflicts


instance methods

    def function(self): ...

instance attributes

    self.property


class attributes(exists across ALL instances)
  > defined without "self."
  > access via ClassName.Attribute
  > any instance can access the value of this
  > value updated across all instances (if class name is used, if instance name is used then changes are exclusive to that instance)


class methods
  > methods with @classmethod decorator
  > shared across all instances (just like class attributes)


inheritance
  > define a class that inherits functionality from a base or parent class
  > done by passing the parent class to the child class definition
