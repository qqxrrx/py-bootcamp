Object Oriented Programming
  > representation of things in world
  > write class to create an object

  Classes
    > blueprint of objects
    > can contain functions or attributes

  Instance
    > objects that are constructed from a class blueprint

  Encapsulation
    > information hiding
    > hide implementation details inside
    > easy code reuse because related logic are bundled into one unit
    > makes abstraction possible

  Abstraction
    > selective access/exposure of properties or functions inside a class
    > private properties or private functions exclusive within a class and can't be used outside
    > python does not support "private", convention is using _ (underscore) before a variable
