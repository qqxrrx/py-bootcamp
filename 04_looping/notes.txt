- allow code execution iteration/repetition
- extract each single data from a collection (iterable object)
- for loop, while loop


for loops

  for <item> in <iterable_object>:

    <item> = references the current position of iterator within the iterable
    <iterable_object> = collection of data

  for <item> in range(a, b):
    range(<start>,<iterations>) = easy way to generate numbers

  range()
    - generate immutable sequence of numbers

    range(n) = give integer from 0 to n-1
    range(a,b) = give integer from a to b-1
    range(x,y,z) = give integer from x to y-1 but skip depending on z
    range(i,j,k) = give integerfrom i to j-1 but reverse depending on k


while loops

  while <condition>:

    <condition> = execute while boolean expression is truthy


controlled exit on loops:

  using keyword 'break'
