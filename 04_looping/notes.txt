- allow code execution iteration/repetition
- extract each single data from a collection (iterable object)
- for loop, while loop


for loops

  for <item> in <iterable_object>:

    <item> = references the current position of iterator within the iterable
    <iterable_object> = collection of data

  for <item> in range():
    range(<start>,<iterations>) = easy way to generate numbers
