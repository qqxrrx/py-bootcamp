Modules

  > keep python files small
  > code reuse across code


  Builtin Modules
    > https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html

    'from' keyword lets you import parts of a module


  Custom Modules
    > can import own code
    > need name of python file


  External Modules
    > https://pypi.org/
    > use pip

      >> pip install termcolor


__name__
  > every python file has this
  > the current __name__ of the one that executes the code is always called "__main__"
  > that's why we use this line to ensure that the file is directly run and not called by another file from an import:

      if __name__ == "__main__":
          # run code
