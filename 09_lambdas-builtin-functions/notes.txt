lambda
  > just like anonymous functions of javascript
  > one line, mostly used on arguments

map()
  > process each item on the list and create a new list from it

filter()
  > only return items to new list where the compared item from old list evaluates to true

~ most of the time, map() and filter() is not needed if it's possible with list comprehension
