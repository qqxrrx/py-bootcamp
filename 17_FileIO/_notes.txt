  > use open() function
      https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=open#open

  > pass filename as argument and returns a file object

  > file.read() function

  > open() works with cursors, once you read the cursor will be at the end

    f = open()
    ....
    f.close()

Cursor Movement
  > if cursor is at the end and there's a file change and try to read the file again the cursor distance to travel is updated
  > seek() = manipulate position of cursor


Close a file
  > f.close()


With Block
  > no need to use f.close()

  with open() as f:
    ...


Writing Files
  > still need to open the file first
  > specifiy "w" flag, default is "r"
  > .write() overwrites everything when we are using mode='w'
