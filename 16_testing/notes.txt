Why do testing?
  > required if deploying to production as insurance
  > write code to monitor code in order to reduce bugs
  > ensure bugs are stay fixed in future code refactor
  > be certain that new features doesn't break old ones
  > clean code that it doesn't introduce bugs


Test Driven Development
  > write tests first before development
  > once tests are written, write code to make tests pass
  > once tests pass, a feature is considered complete


Red -> Green -> Refactor
  > workflow for TDD
  > red = write a test that fails
  > green = write minimal amount of code to make the test pass
  > refactor = clean up the code, ensure that tests still pass


Assertions
  > check if expression is True and return None
  > if expression is False, raise AssertionError
  > old method of testing (replaced by Unit Testing techniques)
  > when python file is run with the -O flag, assertions will not be evaluated
  > avoid using


doctests
  > can write tests for functions inside a docstring
  > write code that looks like it's inside of a REPL
  > too much problem in using (prone to typing errors)
  > avoid using
