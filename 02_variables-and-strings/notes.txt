variables
  - container with a name that stores value in memory
  - should always have a default value during declaration
  - the assigned value decides it's type
  - you can reassign a different value type

  restrictions:
    - must start with a letter or underscore
    - can only consist of letters, numbers or underscores
    - case sensitive

  naming conventions (style guide):
    - variables should be "snake case" or "camel case"
    - variables should be lowercase, upper case if constant
    - upper camel case should be used on classes
    - dunder (Double UNDERscore)... variables that starts with __, just leave it alone


data types
  bool (boolean: True/False)
        only two values used in boolean logic
  int (integer)
        whole numbers
  str (string, "")
        string of characters
  list (list, [...])
        ordered sequence of values
  dict (dictionary, {"":""})
        unordered collection of key-value pairs


dynamic typing
  - variables are flexible, data type can change (dynamic typing) at any point in the code
  - type of value can change depending on the currently assigned of value


None value
  represents the idea of nothingness (null)
  can be the default value of declared variables
  if you want to create a new variable and tell it has no value yet, use None


Strings
  single and double quotes
    - either single quotes '...' or double quotes "..."
    - "so 'that' was there"
    - 'we found the "thing"'
