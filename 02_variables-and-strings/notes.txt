variables
  - container with a name that stores value in memory
  - should always have a default value during declaration
  - the assigned value decides it's type
  - you can reassign a different value type

  restrictions:
    - must start with a letter or underscore
    - can only consist of letters, numbers or underscores
    - case sensitive

  naming conventions (style guide):
    - variables should be "snake case" or "camel case"
    - variables should be lowercase, upper case if constant
    - upper camel case should be used on classes
    - dunder (Double UNDERscore)... variables that starts with __, just leave it alone
