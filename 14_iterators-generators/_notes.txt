Iterator
  > object that can be iterated upon
  > returns data, one element at a time when next() is called on it

Iterable
  > object which will return an Iterator when iter() is called on it


"string-value" = iterable, not an iterator

iter("string-value) = iterator

next() = return one item at a time from an iterator



Generator
  > is an iterator, but not all iterators are generators
  > instead of using 'return' uses 'yield'
  > functions return once, generator can yield multiple times
  > easy way of creating an iterator
  > less memory than a list
