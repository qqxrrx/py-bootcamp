Boolean
  - truthiness
  - True/False


Conditional Statements
  forking paths to code based on comparisons
  if-elif-else


Truthiness or Falsiness
  conditional checks resolve to True (truthy) or False (falsy)
  'is' keyword to check for truthiness or falsiness

  falsy values:
    empty objects
    empty strings
    None
    0 (zero)


Comparison Operators
  testing values to produce a truthy or falsy result
    a == b
    a != b
    a > b
    a < b
    a >= b
    a <= b


Logical Operators
  connect other Comparison Operators together

  (truth table):

  AND
    a   b   a & b   (a and b)
    T   T   T
    T   F   F
    F   T   F
    F   F   F

  OR
    a   b   a | b   (a or b)
    T   T   T
    T   F   T
    F   T   T
    F   F   F

  NOT
    negation, reverse boolean value

  python operators:
    and
      (a > b) and (c > d)
    or
      (a > b) or (c > d)
    not
