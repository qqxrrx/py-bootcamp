Tuple
  > ordered collection or grouping of items
  > like a list BUT using (...)
  > like a list BUT it is immutable (read-only values)
  > faster than lists
  > safe code because values are read-only (immutable)
  > a valid key in a dictionary (example: tuple of coordinates as key and location as value)
  > can use tuple() function
  > use square brackets for data access, only use (...) for creation
  > useful if you want to store values that should not be changed (like english name of months)
