Integer vs Floating Point

  Integer (Int)
    less space needed
    whole numbers, positive or negative

  Floating Point (Float)
    decimal numbers
    more memory space needed due to decimals


Math

  - if you do a mathematical operation between Int and Float, it will be type coerced to Float

  - python division always returns a Float

  - order of operation (precedence):
    P = parentheses       ()
    E = exponentiation    **
    M = multiplication    *
    D = division          /
    R = remainder/modulo  %
    A = addition          +
    S = subtraction       -
