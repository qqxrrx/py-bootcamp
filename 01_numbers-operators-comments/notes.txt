Integer vs Floating Point

  Integer (Int)
    less space needed
    whole numbers, positive or negative

  Floating Point (Float)
    decimal numbers
    more memory space needed due to decimals


Math

  - if you do a mathematical operation between Int and Float, it will be type coerced to Float

  - python division always returns a Float

  - order of operation (precedence):
    P = parentheses
    E = exponents
    M = multiplication
    D = division
    R = remainder/modulo
    A = addition
    S = subtraction
